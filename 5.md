# Cache Write Policies

### Write Policies: Write-Through vs. Write-Back

Write policies dictate how data is written to the cache and the main memory when there is a **write hit** (the data to be written is already in the cache).

* **Write-Through:** In this approach, data is written to **both the cache and the main memory simultaneously**. This ensures that the main memory is always up-to-date. While this method is simple and reliable, it can be slower due to the time it takes to write to the main memory.

* **Write-Back:** With this policy, data is initially written **only to the cache**. The updated data is written back to the main memory at a later time, typically when the cache block is about to be replaced. To keep track of whether the cache block has been modified, a "dirty bit" is used. This method is generally faster as it reduces the number of writes to the slower main memory.

### Write Allocation Policies: Write-Allocate vs. No-Write-Allocate

Write allocation policies come into play during a **write miss** (the data to be written is not present in the cache).

* **Write-Allocate:** When a write miss occurs, the data block is **first loaded from the main memory into the cache**, and then the new data is written to the cache. This policy is often used with write-back caches, as it brings the relevant data into the cache for subsequent writes.

* **No-Write-Allocate:** In this case, on a write miss, the data is **written directly to the main memory without being loaded into the cache**. This approach is typically paired with write-through caches and is useful when data is written but not immediately read again, as it avoids filling the cache with data that might not be needed soon.
