# Multi-Cache Management Policies

## Inclusive Policy
An **inclusive** policy requires that all data in a lower-level cache (e.g., $L1$) must also be present in the next higher-level cache (e.g., $L2$). The $L1$ cache is a strict subset of the $L2$ cache.

* **Advantage:** Simplifies cache coherence, as checking the higher-level cache is sufficient to know if the data exists anywhere in the lower levels.
* **Disadvantage:** Can waste space, as the same data is stored in multiple cache levels.

---
## Exclusive Policy
An **exclusive** policy mandates that the data in the lower-level cache and the higher-level cache are mutually exclusive. A data block is either in the $L1$ or the $L2$ cache, but never both.

* **Advantage:** Maximizes the effective use of total cache capacity.
* **Disadvantage:** Increases complexity. A miss in $L1$ requires checking $L2$. If data is moved from $L2$ to $L1$, a block in $L1$ might need to be evicted back to $L2$.

---
## Non-Inclusive (NINE) Policy
A **non-inclusive** policy has no strict rules. A data block might exist in the $L1$ cache, the $L2$ cache, both, or neither. It offers a flexible middle ground between the other two policies.

* **Advantage:** Provides flexibility to optimize for different workloads.
* **Disadvantage:** More complex to manage than an inclusive policy.
