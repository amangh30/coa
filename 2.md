# Write Policies

### Write-Through
In a **write-through** cache, when the processor writes data, it is written to **both the cache and main memory simultaneously**.

This method ensures that the main memory is always up-to-date with the cache. It's like saving a document to both your hard drive and a USB stick at the exact same time.

* **Pros ✅:**
    * **High Reliability:** Main memory always has the most recent data, which simplifies data recovery after a crash.
    * **Simple Implementation:** It's easier to design and manage.

* **Cons ❌:**
    * **High Latency:** Every write operation has to wait for the slower main memory to complete, which can create a performance bottleneck.
    * **Increased Bus Traffic:** Constant writes to RAM consume a lot of bandwidth on the memory bus.

### Write-Back
In a **write-back** cache, when the processor writes data, it is written **only to the cache block**. The system keeps track of the modified block by setting a special flag called a **dirty bit**.

The data is only written back to main memory later, under specific conditions—typically when the cache block needs to be replaced (evicted) to make room for new data. This is like editing a file on your computer and only saving it to the cloud when you're done or when you close the application.

* **Pros ✅:**
    * **Low Latency:** Writes happen at the speed of the fast cache memory, making write operations very quick.
    * **Reduced Bus Traffic:** Multiple writes to the same cache block only result in a single write to main memory later, saving bandwidth.

* **Cons ❌:**
    * **Data Inconsistency:** If the system crashes before the "dirty" blocks are written back, the changes are lost, and main memory will be out of date.
    * **More Complex:** This policy requires more complex hardware and logic to track the dirty bits and manage the write-back process.
