# Cache Misses


### 1. Compulsory Miss (Cold Miss)
This type of miss occurs the **very first time** a block of memory is accessed. Since the cache is initially empty (or "cold"), the requested data has never been loaded before. These misses are unavoidable because the data must be fetched from main memory at least once.

### 2. Capacity Miss
A capacity miss happens when the cache is full and needs to evict a block to make room for a new one, but the evicted block is needed again later. This means the miss would not have occurred if the cache had been larger. It's not about a specific block being mapped to a specific line, but about the **limited size** of the entire cache. (**INCREASE CACHE SIZE**)

### 3. Conflict Miss
This miss occurs in direct-mapped or set-associative caches when two different memory blocks need to be mapped to the **same cache line** (or set). Even if the cache has plenty of free space elsewhere, a conflict miss happens because the required location is already occupied by another block. If a fully associative cache of the same size would have avoided the miss, it's a conflict miss. (**INCREASE ASSSOCIATIVITY**)
